This plugin was written to make it easier to project the view direction along 
crystallographic directions. 
It adds commands to convert vectors between crystallographic and cartesian coordinates 
and a simple GUI for setting the view. The GUI is largely inspired by the "Orientation" 
window of the program VESTA and the "Set View Direction" window of CrystalMaker.

Note that for the plugin to work, the loaded molecule must contain unit cell information.
